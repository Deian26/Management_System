		<F1_aboutPageInfo> THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT TO BE USED AS AN EXAMPLE OR FOR RESEARCH/DEVELOPEMENT OF OTHER PROGRAMS !
		This program is meant to help manage different groups of files, both locally and on a connected database.
		Current implementation:
			Account system:
				-> 'User' access rights (regular access, can not create admin groups or send admin notifications; also cannot access the utility service)
				-> 'Administrator' ('admin') access rights ('user' access rights and can create admin groups, send admin notifications and access the utility service)
			Utility service:
				-> mainly used to diagnose issues with the program
				-> features currently under implementation: form language and theme packs editor
			Groups:
				-> can contain (open and edit):
					*) Text files (and any file that can be interpreted as a text file)
					*) XML files
					*) Rich text files (.rtf)
					*) Database tables (in the connected database and locally stored)
				-> are stored locally (independently, for each user) and on the connected database
				-> more information about an editor can be found in the respective editor's 'About' form
			Notifications:
				-> can be sent with 2 levels of importance:
					*) normal
					*) admin (important)
				-> can be read by all users (users and administrators)
				-> are stored in the connected database (and in a local file, for each user, in order to only display the unread notifications to individual users)

		<F1_user_rights_information_form_info>
		This form explains the account system used by Management System.
		
		The account system uses 2 types of accounts to grant rights to the users of this program:
		
		1.User rights:
			-> allows users to create groups
			-> allows users to view/add/edit/delete files in groups
			
		2.Administrator rights ('admin rights').
		 The 'Administrator(s)' has the same rights as the 'User' plus:
			-> allows the administrator(s) of the program to create groups marked as 'Admin groups';
			-> allows administrator(s) to send important notifications;
			-> allows administrator(s) access to the Utility service for diagnostic purposes and to change the appearance of the application (add languages and themes)
