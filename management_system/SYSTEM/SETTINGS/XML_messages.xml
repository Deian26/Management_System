		<F1_aboutPageInfo> THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT TO BE USED AS AN EXAMPLE OR FOR RESEARCH/DEVELOPEMENT OF OTHER PROGRAMS !
		This program is meant to help manage different groups of files, both locally and on a connected database.
		Current implementation:
			Account system:
				-> 'User' access rights (regular access, can not create admin groups or send admin notifications; also cannot access the utility service)
				-> 'Administrator' ('admin') access rights ('user' access rights and can create admin groups, send admin notifications and access the utility service)
			Utility service:
				-> mainly used to diagnose issues with the program
				-> features currently under implementation: form language and theme packs editor
			Groups:
				-> can contain (open and edit):
					*) Text files (and any file that can be interpreted as a text file)
					*) XML files
					*) Rich text files (.rtf)
					*) Database tables (in the connected database and locally stored)
				-> are stored locally (independently, for each user) and on the connected database
				-> more information about an editor can be found in the respective editor's 'About' form
			Notifications:
				-> can be sent with 2 levels of importance:
					*) normal
					*) admin (important)
				-> can be read by all users (users and administrators)
				-> are stored in the connected database (and in a local file, for each user, in order to only display the unread notifications to individual users)

		<F1_create_group_guide_form_info>
		This guide explains the basics of creating a new group.
		
		1. Click on the 'New group' button in the main form of the application (the first page after the log in page)
		2. Write the name of the new group (it has to be unique, otherwise the group will no be created; multiple groups cannot have the same name);
		   click on the 'Group icon' button and select the group's image (if not selected, a default (locally stored) image will be loaded.
		3. Click on the 'Create group' button
		4. The new group will be added to the database, the list of groups in the main form and a folder will be created for it in the user's folder.

		<F1_user_rights_information_form_info>
		This form explains the account system used by Management System.
		
		The account system uses 2 types of accounts to grant rights to the users of this program:
		
		1.User rights:
			-> allows users to create groups
			-> allows users to view/add/edit/delete files in groups
			
		2.Administrator rights ('admin rights').
		 The 'Administrator(s)' has the same rights as the 'User' plus:
			-> allows the administrator(s) of the program to create groups marked as 'Admin groups';
			-> allows administrator(s) to send important notifications;
			-> allows administrator(s) access to the Utility service for diagnostic purposes and to change the appearance of the application (add languages and themes)
